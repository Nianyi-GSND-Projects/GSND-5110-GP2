## Objectives

In this [group project](
	https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/193724/assignments/2467174?module_item_id=11106494
), we need to demonstrate our understanding of the parameters that influence gameplay.
We are required to implement a minimal prototype for an existing game, and design two levels for it so that the second level is 30% harder than the first level.
The prototype should be simple enough to balance while preserving the essence of the game.

The target game we chose is _Overcooked!_.

## Outline

1. Get to know the game and identify the "essence"â€”the core mechanism of the game, and trim it down to a minimal state.

	A [game breakdown document](https://github.com/Nianyi-GSND-Projects/GSND-5110-GP2/blob/master/Game%20Breakdown/Game%20Breakdown.md) is written and uploaded here, with suggestions on how we should trim the mechanisms and my ideas on the prototype.

2. Discuss and decide the best approach to prototype this game.

3. Build the prototype.
	- Develop an MDA analysis to steer the work.
	- Track the progress with Trello and team log.
	- Finish it.

4. Design two levels for it and make the second level 30% harder than the first one.
	1. Find the target parameters of our game.
		That is, the parameters used to define the game's difficulty.
	2. Select the critical parameters which could be tweaked to affect the target parameters.
	3. Create a model to describe the relationship between the critical parameters and the target parameters.
	4. Loop on adjusting the parameters and playtesting.

## Class timeline

- Week 1: Discuss with the professor about our prototype design to make sure it's valid and fun.
- Week 2: Discuss the models we developed for measuring the parameters.
	So by this time as I take it, the prototype should be at least minimally playable.
- Week 3: See how the 30% thing works out.
- Week 4: Fine-tune everything.

## What to submit

- The concept and balancing document, together as a PDF.
	The MDA analysis and the links to the Trello board and team log should be included.
- A link to a playthrough video.
- And other individual entries.
