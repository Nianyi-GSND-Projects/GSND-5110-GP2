GSND 5110 Group Project #2

## Objectives

In this [group project](
	https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/193724/assignments/2467174?module_item_id=11106494
), we need to demonstrate our understanding of the parameters that influence gameplay.
We are required to implement a minimal prototype for an existing game, and design two levels for it so that the second level is 30% harder than the first level.
The prototype should be simple enough to balance while preserving the essence of the game.

The target game we chose is _Overcooked!_.
