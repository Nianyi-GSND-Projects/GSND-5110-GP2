## Pre-class Meeting \#1 - 10/08/2024

In this meeting, everyone should have already written a brief report of their ideas on the game's "essence".
We are to discuss and decide how we are going to do this project.

### Attendees

### Minutes

Both Zixun and Nianyi have came up with their game design.
The team will ask for Bob's advice in the afternoon's class and decide which way to go.

## In-class Meeting \#1 - 10/08/2024

### Attendees

Yichi is back to the campus in the noon, ALL members have attended.

### Minutes

Bob said Nianyi's flicking design is more "streamlined", and we should try to join with Zixun's idea together.
We should focus on player experience instead of how similar our mechanism is to _Overcooked!_'s.

### To-do
