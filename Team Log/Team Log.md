## Pre-class Meeting \#1 - 10/08/2024

In this meeting, everyone should have already written a brief report of their ideas on the game's "essence".
We are to discuss and decide how we are going to do this project.

### Attendees

Yichi was with his parents in NYC, so only other members have attended.
Nianyi was ill.

- Nianyi Wang (王念一)
- Siyu Chai (柴思宇)
- Zixun Yan (严子迅)

### Minutes

Both Zixun and Nianyi have came up with their game design.
The team will ask for Bob's advice in the afternoon's class and decide which way to go.

## In-class Meeting \#1 - 10/08/2024

### Attendees

Yichi is back to the campus in the noon, ALL members have attended.

### Minutes

Bob said Nianyi's flicking design is more "streamlined", and we should try to join with Zixun's idea together.
We should focus on player experience instead of how similar our mechanism is to _Overcooked!_'s.

### To-do

- [x] Update Trello board.
- [x] Assign team roles.

## Game Lab Meeting - 10/10/2024

Zixun called for a meeting in the CAMD Game Lab for deciding how the core game loop would be like.
Also the team roles need to be decided.

### Attendees

The orange line is under maintainance so Siyu couldn't come (it'd take 2 hours for him to go to the campus).

- Nianyi Wang (王念一)
- Yichi Zhang (张亦驰)
- Zixun Yan (严子迅)

### Minutes

The game's core loop remains basically the same as Nianyi's original idea, but with a few tweaks.

Team roles:

- Nianyi as the "implementor", taking charge of making the board & the digital timer required by the game.
- Zixun as the artist.
- Yichi & Siyu will work together to finalize the game design.
